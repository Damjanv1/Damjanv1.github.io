# Brief thoughts on DEX

I have been using the DEX features on my new Samsung galaxy phone, and have been thoroughly impressed. With it i am able to use my mobile for woprd processing tasks and other simple computing tasks.
I particularly enjoy it beacause it allows me to free up my workdesk and my compute device is a tiny mobile and a slightly larger bluetooth keyboard. Being able to connect the Samsung device to external monitors is also advantageous as this means that I can  get better use from the stylus by viewing anyy drawings or renderings on a larger screen.

Finally it allows me to watch TV shows and other media content simply by plugging in my phoner and brining up the required app, saving ample time on set up compared to laptops and other devices.
